#### Interaction States

Most Kirby components have had an overhaul of how they look and behave when you interact with them using a keyboard or a pointing device like a mouse. This has been done by improving _Interaction States_ - and adding some that where missing.

<dl>
<dt>Hover</dt>
<dd>When you move the mouse cursor over an element. It's not a thing on touch devices.</dd>
<dt>Active</dt>
<dd>While you click or press an element it becomes active. When you release it, the element is no longer active.</dd>
<dt>Focus</dt>
<dd>When an element receives focus you can interact with it using a keyboard. E.g. submitting a form or following a link Elements can receive focus by using <code>TAB</code> on a keyboard, but also programmatically or by clicking on it. Not all elements will (or should) receive focus.</dd>

##### How desktop ready are Kirby components?

Interaction states are not relevant for all components. See the table below for the current state of how _desktop ready_ each relevant component is:

#### Attention level 4 is deprecated

In order to clarify and simplify the design of the `<kirby-button>` attention levels it has been revised. Attention level 4 has been deprecated and the continued usage of this level will result in a console deprecation warning message and the button will be rendered as attention level 3.

Up until now attention level 4 has primarily been used for transparent icon-only buttons. The continued need for this specific kind of buttons has been recognized and is now available through a new `noDecoration` parameter of `<kirby-button>` .

Furthermore the design of `<kirby-button>` on all light backgrounds is now identical to the their former presence on a _white_ kirby-card background. The biggest visual change will be on `<kirby-button>` s with attention level 2 on a _light_ `<kirby-card>` which will have their background color change from _white_ to _black_.

##### Migration

- When migrating change attention level 2 to attention level 3 on all `<kirby-button>` s which aren't black by design
- Also replace all attention level 4 usage on icon-only `<kirby-button>` s with the new no-decoration parameter

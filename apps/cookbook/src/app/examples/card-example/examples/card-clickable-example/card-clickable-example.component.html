      Giving a card any click event <code>(click)="function()"</code> will change your cursor to a
      pointer when hovering the card. To ensure that the card is accessible by keyboard, the card
      gets a tab-index so it can be focused by tabbing. To mirror a button's behavior, any
      registered click-event will also be called by pressing enter and space when the card is
      focused.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <code>mode="flat"</code> has been given to the card, it will automatically be reverted to
      default elevation.

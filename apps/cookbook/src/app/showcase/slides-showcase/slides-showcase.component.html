      <strong>Note:</strong>
      Loading lots of data in many cards can result in an unwanted pause while the slides content
      are beeing rendered. (The data is recieved, spinner dissapears but seconds passes before the
      cards are rendered) The notations:<br />
      <code>
        *kirbySlide="let slide; let i = index"<br />
        [slideIndex]="i"<br />
        [activeSlideIndex]="selectedSlideIndex<br />
      </code>
      gives you means to pass info to each slide´s content about what index it has and compare that
      to the activeSlideIndex, and thereby a way to render only a few cards in advance.

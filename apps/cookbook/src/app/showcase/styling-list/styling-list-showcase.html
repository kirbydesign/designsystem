  Kirby offers default styling of ordered <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and unordered
  <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> lists (but not description lists <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>).

<h2>How to "opt-out" list styling</h2>
<p>
  In some cases you may not want the default styling. A common example is a navigation menu where an
  HTML list is used but styled to not look like a list. You’re probably already overriding the
  default user agent styles for lists. In addition you may want to override some or all of the Kirby
  default list styling. Which declarations should be made could differ depending on the specific
  case.

<p>To remove the custom markers (bullets):</p>
<cookbook-code-viewer language="css">
  li::before
  <pre>
  {{ '{' }}
     display: none;
  {{ '}' }} </pre
  >
</cookbook-code-viewer>
<br />
<p>
  To remove or control the space between list items you’ll want to target list items with
  sufficiently high specificity, e.g.:
</p>
<cookbook-code-viewer language="css">
  ol li, ul li
  <pre>
  {{ '{' }}
     margin-block-start: revert;
  {{ '}' }} </pre
  >
</cookbook-code-viewer>
<br />
<p>
  You may also want to change the display and line-height properties on list items li. Which values
  to use will depend on the specific case.

<div class="example">
  <h1><code>kirby-toolbar</code> has been removed</h1>
  <p>Use <code>kirby-page</code> instead as this has toolbar functionality integrated.</p>
  <!-- 
    href is being used instead of routerLink on purpose, 
    see issue: https://github.com/kirbydesign/designsystem/issues/1489

  <p>See <a href="/home/showcase/page">the page showcase</a> for more information.</p>
  <p>
    There currently exists a seperate toolbar component in Sketch. It will be removed in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    This cookbook page will be removed once the disprancy between Sketch and the library has been
    fixed.

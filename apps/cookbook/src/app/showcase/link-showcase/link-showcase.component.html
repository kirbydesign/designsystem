<p>
  Links are used for navigation between pages. They can be standalone links used on their own or
  inline links placed within a sentence.
</p>
<p>
  A link should be used for simple navigation. That is, situations where the user will be sent to a
  new resource or destination in the app via a <code>href</code>. Use
  <a routerLink="/home/showcase/button">buttons</a> instead of links if the user is not redirected
  to a new destination but instead triggers an action, makes a choice, or in any way manipulate
  data.
</p>
<p>
  Rather than providing a component for links Kirby simply provides custom styles for the
  <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag that gives a consistent look and feel of links. Links have an underline
  and inherit the text color of the surrounding elements. The color of visited links does not
  change.
</p>

<h2>Sizes</h2>
<p>
  By default, links inherit the font-size of the context they are used in. For standalone links, any
  font-class from <a routerLink="/home/showcase/fonts">Kirby Fonts</a> can be applied. For
  accessibility reasons it is not recommended to use links when the clickable text is smaller than
  12px (extra small).

  <cookbook-link-example-default #internal></cookbook-link-example-default>
</cookbook-example-viewer>

<h2>New tab</h2>
<p>
  The default behavior is to open the link in the current tab. If an anchor-tag has
  <code>target="_blank"</code> it will get an icon to signal to the user that a new tab will open.
</p>

<cookbook-example-viewer [html]="newTab.template">
  <cookbook-link-example-new-tab #newTab></cookbook-link-example-new-tab>
</cookbook-example-viewer>

<p>
  It is recommended to only use this option for standalone links that are not used within a
  paragraph or in any other way embedded in text. Consider writing out the source for inline links
  so it is clear that clicking the link will take the user to a new context, e.g.
  <a href="https://github.com/kirbydesign/designsystem">www.github.com/kirbydesign/designsystem</a>.
  Then the user can choose how they want to open the link.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Note:</b> In a non-web context, i.e. an app, any link will most likely launch the device's
  browser and effectively open a new tab outside the app context.

  <h1>Accessibility in Kirby</h1>

  <h2>Can Kirby make an application accessible?</h2>
  <p>The short answer is no.</p>
  <p>
    The accessibility of an application largely depends on its markup. In other words, it depends on
    how the components in Kirby are used. The role of the components is to allow for developers to
    make their applications accessible; they should not be in the way.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means the developer has a lot of responsibility to ensure their application is accessible.
    All of this might be frustrating news for those new to accessibility; where to begin?
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides, accessibility is hard. There is a lot to consider when thinking about the accessibility
    of an application as can be seen in the following sections. But

    >
      as with fixing a bug
    </a>
    , it is easier to consider accessibility from the start; the further in an applications
    lifecycle it is improved, the more expensive and harder it is to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    We in team Kirby believe it is the job of a responsible frontend developer to prioritize and
    care about accessibility. See it as an opportunity to learn more about the web technologies you
    are building with every day and

      exploring new ways of improving your product for everyone
    </a>
    .
  </p>
  <p>So where do you begin? Our suggestion is to read on!</p>

  <h3>Mindset - what is accessibility?</h3>
  <p>
    In an attempt to make it easier to get started with accessibility, the following section details
    our mindset towards accessibility and how we think about it in Team Kirby.
  </p>

  <h4>Accessibility is not a feature</h4>
  <p>Accessibility is not something that is tagged onto an application like a feature.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>All</strong>
    applications have some degree of accessibility, whether it is considered or not. If it is not
    actively prioritized, the accessibility of an application is most likely poor. It is similar to
    the quality of a codebase; simply by existing it has some degree of quality. Not prioritizing it
    might have consequences in the long run, such as the codebase being hard to modify. Analogously
    not prioritizing accessibility might make an application impossible to use for people with
    various disabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then how can it be improved? Beginning applying ARIA tags and using automated tests such as
    Lighthouse, might spring to mind. This is definitely better than nothing. However accessibility
    is more than that.
  </p>

  <h4>A whole different UX</h4>
  <p>
    The markup might be correct and all the correct ARIA tags can be utilized. But if for example an
    application relies on color to convey important information, that will be lost on someone who is
    color blind, unless it is supplemented in other ways. This is not something that can be caught
    by an automated test but requires context and the insight of a human.
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise consider someone using a screen reader to search through a list containing hundreds of
    records based on date. If the date text reads "Created on March 25", they will have to wait for
    "created on" to be read aloud for every record. If the structure was instead altered to be
    "March 25, created on" the important information would be read aloud first.
  </p>
  <p>
    In many ways working with accessibility is improving a whole different UX than the one people
    without disabilities is used to. It has its own patterns, pains and ways of being used.
  </p>
  <h4>More than screen readers</h4>
  <p>
    Many developers will be aware of the fact that their application might be accessed by users
    depending on screen readers. If this is the only focus in terms of accessibility, the
    application is mainly made more accessible for those with disabilities affecting sight.
  </p>
  <p>
    However there are a lot of disabilities to consider when improving accessibility. Someone who
    has trouble hearing or is deaf will need captions to understand videos. A person with motor
    problems will have a hard time clicking an element within a timespan.
  </p>
  <p>
    Someone with
    <a target="_blank" href="https://webaim.org/articles/seizure/">vestibular or seizure</a>
    disorder would prefer that their
    <a target="_blank" href="https://web.dev/prefers-reduced-motion/">
      preference for reduced motion
    </a>
    is respected. If not they might get nauseous or have an outright seizure if excessive motion
    such as parallax scrolling or strobelight like effects is used.
  </p>
  <h4>An ego-centric argument for accessibility</h4>
  <p>
    To conclude accessibility is many things. Various aspects of your application ranging from the
    markup to design are affected by it.
  </p>
  <p>
    And it might seem overwhelming... So besides helping those with disabilities to access and use
    the digital tools we all rely on in the 21st century; why care as a developer without any
    disabilities?
  </p>
  <p>
    So here is a more ego-centric argument for caring about accessibility: you will most likely be
    disabled to some degree in the future. Apologies if it sounds bleak.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might break your dominant arm causing you to rely on keyboard navigation. More severely you
    could get into a car accident paralyzing you from the neck down. Moreover your sight, motor
    skills and reaction time will most likely decrease as you get older.
  </p>
  <p>
    In any case would you be able to rely on the digital tools you do now in a world where
    developers do not consider accessibility?
  </p>
  <h2>Kirby's role</h2>
  <p>
    As mentioned the accessibility of an application largely depends on how it is built and
    designed. This means that the Kirby design system can not magically make an application
    accessible. So what is Kirby's role exactly when it comes to accessibility?
  </p>
  <h3>Do not be in the way</h3>
  <p>
    The components in the Kirby design system should allow developers to create accessible
    applications; they can be thought of as HTML elements. It is possible to use them in ways that
    allows for accessibility. On the contrary, it is also possible to use them in a lot of
    completely inaccessible ways.
  </p>
  <p>But the components in Kirby should never be in the way of making an application accessible.</p>
  <p>
    If a developer ever experiences that a Kirby component causes problems when working with
    accessibility; do not hesitate to create an issue in the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kirbydesign/designsystem/issues/new/choose">
      Kirby Design System Github repository
    </a>
    .
  </p>

  <h3>A knowledge source</h3>
  <p>
    While we are not there yet; we desire to give developers using the Kirby design system the best
    possible foundation for working with accessibility in their applications. We wish to highlight
    do's, don'ts, anti-patterns and best practices as part of the documentation for the components
    in Kirby.
  </p>

  <h2>We need the help of developers</h2>
  <p>
    In Team Kirby we are on a learning journey ourselves. In order to be able to meet our desire to
    become a knowledge source, we need the help of developers using Kirby.
  </p>
  <p>
    If they have encountered any anti-patterns, best practices, do's or don'ts in their
    applications. Then we would like to hear about it in order to highlight it as part of the
    documentation so other developers can learn from their experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have created a Github discussions thread where experiences can be shared
    <a href="https://github.com/kirbydesign/designsystem/discussions/1898" target="_blank">here</a>
    . If a submission is highlighted in the documentation it will happen anonymously.
  </p>

  <h2>How do I get started improving the accessibility of my application?</h2>
  <p>
    A lot of great material is freely available online; so instead of reiterating what they already
    state, we will point you in the direction of some of our favorite resources.
  </p>

  <h3>A11y.coffee: A great starting point</h3>
  <p>
    The content on
    <a href="https://a11y.coffee" target="_blank">a11y.coffee</a>
    is a great starting point; especially its
    <a target="_blank" href="https://a11y.coffee/a11y-testing-making-coffee/">coffee metaphor</a>
    serves as a good overview of testing methods. Furthermore it also has a list of
    <a target="_blank" href="https://a11y.coffee/quick-wins/">quick wins</a>
    for those who want to get their hands dirty.
  </p>

  <h3>Check out the WCAG standard</h3>
  <p>
    WCAG is the standard by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) that explains how to make
    content more accessible to people with disabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is worth checking out as it is the standard upon which all other work in the web
    accessibility domain is based.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">This overview</a>
    serves as a good starting point for diving into the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank">WCAG standard</a>
    .
  </p>

  <h3>Topics for exploration</h3>
  <p>
    When diving into a new field it can be useful to have some topics and a general idea of which
    way to direct learning. We believe the following topics are important to have knowledge about,
    when getting into web accessibility:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://a11y.coffee/start-testing/">How to evaluate accessibility</a>
      in your application. As mentioned, automatic testing can not be relied on alone; skill and
      education is required as a developer.
    </li>
    <li>
      How to write proper
      <a target="_blank" href="https://jerryjones.dev/2020/04/20/the-importance-of-html/">
        semantic markup
      </a>
      . This is how to gain the most with the least effort. Not only does it benefit people with
      disabilities; it makes your application more robust, future proof and is easier for computers
      to process.
    </li>
    <li>
      How and
      <a target="_blank" href="https://gomakethings.com/when-should-you-use-aria/">when</a>
      to use ARIA attributes.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Resources</h3>
  <p>
    While a11y.coffee has a
    <a target="blank" href="https://a11y.coffee/dig-in/">list of resources</a>
    to further explore the field of accessibility, we would like to supplement that with some of our
    own resources:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a target="blank" href="https://webaim.org/articles/">WebAIM articles</a>
      : a list of high quality articles from WebAIM ranging from a

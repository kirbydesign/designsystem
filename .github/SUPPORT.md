## I have a question related to Kirby

<!-- This section is responsible for teaching contributors how to get help with Kirby, we should probably link to this section from the readme.md -->
We have **Kirby Open Office** every Tuesday and Thursday between 9:15 to 10:15. During these timeslots we will answer questions asked in the @kirby-design/kirby-guild slack channel and inquiry requests submitted on github. You are always welcome to ask questions outside these timeslots and we will answer it when we got time. 

**Do not send direct messages to members of team-kirby:** This is not because we do not want to talk to you - we however prefer questions to be asked in public, such that everyone can benefit from the answers. 

### Submit an inquiry request on github 

You should submit an inquiry request if __If what? What are we trying to achieve with inquiry requests that we do not get from the slack channel?__ 

To do this create a [new issue](https://github.com/kirbydesign/designsystem/issues/new/choose) using the inquiry-template. Make sure to read and fill out the template correctly, as this will ease our work in answering your question.

### Ask in the kirby-guild slack channel

You should ask a question in the @kirby-design/kirby-guild slack channel if: __Same question as above__. 

### Getting access to the #Kirby-guild slack channel

# Help!: I have a question related to Kirby

We use Github discussions for providing support, answering questions, general discussion and announcements; it can be accessed [here](https://github.com/kirbydesign/designsystem/discussions).

If you have a question you are seeking an answer to - you can create a new discussion with your question and set the category to Q&A as this marks it as "unanswered".

We have **Kirby Open Office** every Tuesday and Thursday between 9:15 to 10:15. This is a dedicated timeslot where we answer questions posted to Github discussions. 

**Do not send direct messages to members of team-kirby:** This is not because we do not want to talk to you - we however prefer questions to be asked in public, such that everyone can benefit from the answers.

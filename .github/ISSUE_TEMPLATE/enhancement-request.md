<!--**Mandatory steps to ensure alignment between stakeholders and the progression of Kirby**-->

<!--*New*-->

<!--*NOT Prioritized*-->
<!--Describe any deadlines for the issue - eg. X needs this done by Y date, to be used in Z sprint. Suggest a milestone for the issue. The `Not Prioritized` label will be removed by the Kirby team. -->

<!--*NOT UX Refined*-->
<!--Make sure the new Component, has a name, can be found in Zeplin, and is used in minimum one reviewed screen. Remove the `NOT UX Refined` label and add links to Zeplin.-->

<!--*NOT Tech Refined*-->
<!--Sketch a solution in technical terms, that is how will the component be enhanced - eg. build it from scratch or build using X Ionic component. Call for a brief meeting or spend enough time with someone from @kirbydesign/kirby-guild to get a "go ahead". Remove the `NOT Tech Refined` label.-->

## Setup environment and tooling for contribution
<!-- The following section is responsible for teaching people how to get setup with 
the repo such that they can get coding -->

### Clone and install repository 
- how to clone and get going with the kirby repo

### Node 
- Which version should people use, and perhaps a recommendation on which tool people can use to manage versions. 

### Tslint 
- People should make sure to have it enabled to avoid unnecessary comments during code review

### Prettier
- It is a good idea to use format-on-save

## Creating pull-requests 
<!-- This section is responsible for guiding contributors on how they should submit pull-requests in a way that ensures the most swift process and teach them how to catch low-hanging issues there might come up in code-review. -->

### Before you submit  
- Make sure you have completed the steps in: [Setup tooling for contribution](#setup-tooling-for-contribution)
- Make sure you have written tests according to the guidelines described in [The good: test](#test)
- Do a self-review <!-- We could link to self-review in the templates and have people check it off? -->

### After you submit 
- Post in Kirby-guild 
- Code reviews are meant to align your code with existing code 
  - While your implementation might be perfectly valid, we are aiming for uniformity across the codebase. 
- Don't commit and exit - make sure to stay responsive and come back to answer comments on your code review

## The good:
<!-- The following sections have the responsibility of explaining contributors our best pratices such that they can more easily have their changes implemented in kirby --> 
<!-- Ideally we should be able to refer to these sections if people break the guidelines in their issue or pull-requests, to make sure we are all preaching the same guidelines -->

### Issue 
- General properties we are looking for and how to achieve them 
  - Readability 
  - Easily understandable 
    - No internal lingo 
  - Proof-read
  - Self-contained
    - Screenshots if necessary
    <!-- I think the following point is important if Kirby is to be spread out amongst several teams -->
    - Don't assume people have knowledge outside of Kirby - contributors might come from many different projects 

### Commit
- Focus on one thing per commit 
- Keep changes as small as possible 
- Only commit related functinoality for each commit 
- Commit often
- Strive for each commit to compile/build and pass tests 
- sidenote: when merging the CI pipeline combines each commit to a merge commit containing all commit messages

### Self-review 
- Don't change files that is not related to your pull-request
  - for example don't reorder imports in files that is not directly related to the issue at hand
- Check for unused imports
- Other self review points go here

### Pull-request
- How is a pull-request that is easily reviewed constructed?

### Test
- How should testing be done 

## I have a question related to Kirby
<!-- This section is responsible for teaching contributors how to get help with Kirby, we should probably link to this section from the readme.md -->
We have **Kirby Open Office** every Tuesday and Thursday between 9:15 to 10:15. During these timeslots we will answer questions asked in the @kirby-design/kirby-guild slack channel and inquiry requests submitted on github. You are always welcome to ask questions outside these timeslots and we will answer it when we got time. 

**Do not send direct messages to members of team-kirby:** This is not because we do not want to talk to you - we however prefer questions to be asked in public, such that everyone can benefit from the answers. 

### Submit an inquiry request on github 
You should submit an inquiry request if __If what? What are we trying to achieve with inquiry requests that we do not get from the slack channel?__ 

To do this create a [new issue](https://github.com/kirbydesign/designsystem/issues/new/choose) using the inquiry-template. Make sure to read and fill out the template correctly, as this will ease our work in answering your question.

### Ask in the kirby-guild slack channel
You should ask a question in the @kirby-design/kirby-guild slack channel if: __Same question as above__. 

If you do not have access you should: __who should be contacted for access?__

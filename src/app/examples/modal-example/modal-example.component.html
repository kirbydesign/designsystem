<!--
    // To show the modal, create a ModalConfig and pass it to the ModalService.showModal:
    const config: ModalConfig = {
      title: 'Betal & OverfÃ¸r',
      titleHorizontalAlignment: 'center',
      component: PayAndTransferEmbeddedModalExampleComponent,
    };
    this.modalService.showModal(config, this.vcRef);
    
    //To create a nested component, ensure:
    // 1) the nested component must be declared (module file, or inside your @Component decorator)
    // 2) the nested component must be listed in your entryComponents (module file) 
    // 3) (Optional) the nested component must implement EmbeddedModal 
    //    which allows you to obtain an uid for your modal and use it to 
    //    closing the modal from within your nested component with a custom callback

    // In order to close a modal from within your nested component, you can use: 
    this.modalService.hideModal(this.uid, yourCallbackFunction...);
    
    // It is possible to nest more modals from within your nested components, 
    // by using the same services and principles as above

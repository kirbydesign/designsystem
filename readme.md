## About

Kirby Design System is a UX Component library implementing the [Kirby Design Philosophy][kirby.design].

Kirby Components are built on top of [Angular][angular] and can be used in Angular projects.

The Kirby Cookbook, containing samples, status of components etc. can be accessed from [https://cookbook.kirby.design][kirby.cookbook].

## Installation

Install through npm:

```bash
npm i @kirbydesign/designsystem
```

### Include KirbyModule

Import the `KirbyModule` in your `AppModule` :

```ts
import { KirbyModule } from '@kirbydesign/designsystem';

...

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        ...,
        KirbyModule
    ],
    ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Sass

Include the Kirby global styles in your app, e.g., in `src/styles.scss`:

```css
@import '~@kirbydesign/designsystem/scss/global-styles';
```

In each `.scss` file where you need to access the Sass utility functions from Kirby (e.g. [colors][kirby.cookbook.colors] or [fonts][kirby.cookbook.fonts]) you must import the scss utilities:

```css
@import '~@kirbydesign/designsystem/scss/utils';
```

#### Generic Print Styles (Optional)

Kirby also provides a generic print stylesheet. It includes the basics. You most likely have to add local print styles specific to your app as well.

Import it into your app, e.g., in `src/styles.scss` or in your local print stylesheet if you have one:

```css
@import '~@kirbydesign/designsystem/scss/print';
```

### Testing

To unit-test applications using Kirby's Components, we recommend importing one of the following modules:

- When using [jasmine][jasmine]: `import { KirbyTestingModule } from '@kirbydesign/designsystem/`**`testing-jasmine'`**`;`
- When using [jest][jest]: `import { KirbyTestingModule } from '@kirbydesign/designsystem/`**`testing-jest'`**`;`

Example:

```ts
import { KirbyTestingModule } from '@kirbydesign/designsystem/testing-jasmine';

describe('AppComponent', () => {
  beforeEach(async(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [KirbyTestingModule],
      declarations: [AppComponent]
    }).compileComponents();
  }));

  ...

});
```

For unit test performance reasons it's highly recommended to utilize these modules, since they provide a template-less implementation of the Kirby Components, but still translude content through `<ng-content></ng-content>` and provide `@Input` -decorated properties and `@Output` -decorated `EventEmitter` s, without
having to reflow the DOM, execute component logic etc.

### Migration Guide

To upgrade, please perform the following tasks:

- `v0.x.x` => `v1.0.0`

  #### Simplified namespaces

  Import `@kirbydesign/designsystem` instead of `@kirbydesign/designsystem/list` or `@kirbydesign/designsystem/modal` . This can be done by executing the following commands (Mac/Linux and Windows respectively):

  ##### Mac / Linux

```sh
  cd <root folder of your application>
  find . -name "*.ts" ! -name "*.spec.ts" -type f -exec sed -i '' -e "s|from '@kirbydesign/designsystem/.*';$|from '@kirbydesign/designsystem';|g" {} \;
  find . -name "*.spec.ts" -type f -exec sed -i '' -e "s|from '@kirbydesign/designsystem/testing';$|from '@kirbydesign/designsystem/testing-jasmine';|g" {} \;
```

_Note: If you're using `jest` you should replace with `@kirbydesign/designsystem/testing-jest` instead._

##### Windows

```sh
  cd <root folder of your application>
  Get-ChildItem "*.ts" -Recurse | ForEach {
  (Get-Content $_ | ForEach  { $_ `
    -replace "from '@kirbydesign/designsystem/((?!testing).)*';$", "from '@kirbydesign/designsystem';" `
    -replace "from '@kirbydesign/designsystem/testing';$", "from '@kirbydesign/designsystem/testing-jasmine';" `
  }) | Set-Content $_
  }
```

_Note: If you're using `jest` you should replace with `@kirbydesign/designsystem/testing-jest` instead._

#### Change TypeScript configuration

Due to Kirby not being distributed as a source-distribution package any more, changes to `tsconfig.json` , `tsconfig.app.json` as well as `tsconfig.spec.json` should be reverted:

In `tsconfig.json` :

- Remove the line `"./node_modules/@kirbydesign/designsystem/**/*.ts"` from the `includes`-array

In `tsconfig.app.json` :

- Remove the line `"./node_modules/@kirbydesign/designsystem/**/*.ts"` from the `includes`-array
- Remove the line `"../node_modules/@kirbydesign/designsystem/testing/**/*.*"` from the `excludes` -array

In `tsconfig.spec.json` :

- Remove the line `"../node_modules/@kirbydesign/designsystem/**/*.ts",` from the `includes`-array

#### Changed dependencies

Remove any previously installed dev-dependencies for `sass-extract` , `sass-extract-loader` and `ng-mocks` _(unless otherwise used in your application)_.
This can be done by the following command:

`npm uninstall --save-dev sass-extract sass-extract-loader ng-mocks`

### Icons

Kirby comes bundled with a default set of icons. Make sure the `.svg` files used by Kirby are copied to your output folder by adding the following to `build > options > assets` in `angular.json` :

```json
{
  ...
  "build": {
    "options": {
      "assets": [
        ...,
        {
          "glob": "**/*.svg",
          "input": "node_modules/@kirbydesign/designsystem/icons/svg",
          "output": "./assets/kirby/icons/svg"
        },
        {
          "glob": "close.svg",
          "input": "node_modules/@kirbydesign/designsystem/icons/svg",
          "output": "./svg"
        },
        ...
      ],
    }
  }
}
```

## Folder Structure

| transpile:tools   | Transpiles tools, required to produce library distribution (this is done as a `post-install` hook, but may have value if altering tool implementation) |

## Developing new features in Kirby

When developing new features in the Kirby Designsystem library, please follow the process described below:

### "New feature"-process

TBD

### Testing new features

Developing new features should also include that they should be tested.

1. Make sure that the code is unit tested.
2. Make sure that examples and showcases are added for the new features (in the cookbook)

   ... this will also act as documentation for users of the Designsystem library.

3. Test the new features in your own application

   The easiest way to do this is to build a distribution package, and install it in your own project.

```
   # 1. From the root of this repository, run (this may take a minute or two):
   npm run publish

   # Then, from the root of your application, execute:
   npm i <path-to-root-of-designsystem>/dist/kirbydesign-designsystem-<version>.tgz

   # ... where <path-to-root-of-designsystem> is replaced with the real path
   #     and <version> is the version of designsystem that was build (in the previous step)

   # You do NOT want to commit the changes made to package.json and package-lock.json to your code base!
```

## Polyfills

Some features of Kirby requires polyfills to ensure compability across all major browsers _(e.g. the `ResizeObserverService` used by the automagic sizing feature of the `Kirby Card` component)_.

To enable the polyfill, you register a _polyfill loader_ that checks whether the polyfill is needed or the feature is already supported by the browser (and can skip requesting the polyfill).  
To use the sizing feature of Kirby Card across all major browsers, you must copy additional files from the Kirby package to your output folder.  
Add the following to `build > options > assets` in `angular.json` :

```json
{
  ...
  "build": {
    "options": {
      "assets": [
        ...,
        {
          "glob": "**/*",
          "input": "./node_modules/@kirbydesign/designsystem/polyfills",
          "output": "./kirby/polyfills"
        },
        ...
      ],
    }
  }
}
```

Finally, add the following to `index.html` :

```html
<head>
  ...
  <script src="kirby/polyfills/resize-observer-polyfill-loader.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

_**Please note:** If you don't want the additional http request for the polyfill loader, you can copy the contents of `node_modules/@kirbydesign/designsystem/polyfills/resize-observer-polyfill-loader.js` into a `script` tag in `index.html` instead_
